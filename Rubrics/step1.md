# DATA 533: Collaborative Software Development

# Project Step 1

## Objectives
1. Learning the fundamental Python modules and packages
2. Understanding how to create modules and packages in Python
3. Understanding how to build a package in collaboration with a version control tool 

## Overall goal
In this lab, you will work collaboratively in a group of two to develop a Python package. Your package could contain functions entirely new to the Python ecosystem, improve upon pre-existing functions or re-implement existing code/functions that you wish to deepen your understanding of (e.g., a linear regression package from scratch).

## Task 1: Group formation
Students are required to work in a group for the project. I have already created a group of 2 and you will find the information in Canvas (please go to `Canvas` -> `People` -> `Groups`). 

## Task 2: Package topic selection (3 marks)
Each group is required to select a topic to develop the package. Sample project ideas are listed below (**you are welcome to come up with your idea**):

- Quizzing App
- Carpooling System 
- Car sharing System 
- Garden/Orchard management 
- Utility Billing System
- Supermarket System
- Building a household budget
- Old home management
- Medicine management
- Pet safety management
- Information on Anthropogenic GHG emissions
- Bank Management Software

Here are videos of two past projects:
- [Sample Project 1](https://youtu.be/tifnmoIChfkLinks) 
- [Sample Project 2](https://youtu.be/JDaoe_6a7Yo)

Students need to write a brief description of the package and functions (max 1000 characters, with spaces) that they plan to implement and upload to Canvas by **December 5, 2022 at 8.00 pm**.

## Task 3: Working on the Package (13 marks)
Now it's time to start developing the package. Specific expectations for this task are:
- Set-up an appropriate directory structure (file and folder organization) for your package [1 mark].
- Use Python to write the package that contains at least four useful functions. These are the functions you proposed in step 2. [8 marks].
    - Create a package with two sub-packages. Each sub-package must have at least two modules and each module should have at least three methods/functions. Each member of the group is expected to do one of the sub-packages. 
    - One module must use inheritance.
    - The person who did not write a particular sub-package must write the documentation for the package as well as create a test Python file demonstrating how to use the package.
- Write a .md file explaining the function details and how they work [1 mark].
- Use version control features to collaborate with your team members. Have a Git history to demonstrate that the group members contributed equally [3 marks]. 

## Task 4: Presentation (4 marks)
Students are required to present their project details on **December 6, 2022**. The presentation slides should include the following:
- Project title and student information
- Project description (e.g., an overview of what your system will do)
- Details on four useful functions with packages, sub-packages, modules and methods/functions (e.g., what each module will do). Please do not show any code here, just textual description.

## Submission instructions: 
Please upload the following information (one submission per group is sufficient)
- Task 2 (Deadline: December 05, 2022 8:00 pm): Upload a PDF file in Canvas. Please include both students' information (e.g., name) there. 
- Task 3 (Deadline: December 12, 2022 8:00 pm): Submit the GitHub classroom link in Canvas. 
- Task 4 (Deadline: December 06, 2022 11:00 am - 12:30 pm): In-class project presentation.
